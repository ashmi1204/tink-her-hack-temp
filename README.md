### Hosted Project Link
[mention your project hosted link here]

### Project Description
An app interface that connects people/organisations with excess food to those in need and thereby minimising the food wastage.Donor can provide details like food type,pickup location,deadline etc and the accepter can claim the food and do the pickup as needed.

### The Problem statement
Large quantities of food are being wasted in functions and restaurants due to the lack of proper coordination between food donors and acceptors which causes hunger and starvation.

### The Solution
We created a mobile application that connects the donors with the acceptors hence helping those in need of food.Available and donatable food are being posted by the donor and acceptors can claim the food if they are in the vicinity.The available food list gets updated accordingly.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
