### Project Description
[A smart mobile application that bridges the gap between excess food and those in need. By enabling instant donor-NGO coordination and real-time status tracking, it minimizes food waste while maximizing social impact.]

### The Problem statement
[Large quantities of edible food are wasted daily by restaurants, events, and households, while nearby communities and shelters struggle with food shortages. The lack of a real-time coordination system between food donors and NGOs leads to missed redistribution opportunities, increased landfill waste, and preventable hunger.]

### The Solution
[Large quantities of edible food are wasted daily by restaurants, events, and households, while nearby communities and shelters struggle with food shortages. The lack of a real-time coordination system between food donors and NGOs leads to missed redistribution opportunities, increased landfill waste, and preventable hunger.]
